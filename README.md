# webtoon-language-learning

## Overview

This was created with the hope of using webtoons as a medium to facilitate language learning while doing something fun. The main idea is to get the same webtoon in two languages (One your learning and one you know). Show the language you are trying to learn and if you don't know a word or want clarification you can click on an image and it'll swap the language to the one you know. However, there are some difficulties with the way images are formatted. For example both webtoons.com and comic.naver.com are both platforms created by Naver the korean media company. However the way they distribute and format the images making up the webtoon are very different. For example 1 "image" in comic.naver.com could be 4 images from webtoon.com. This lead to scaling issues as well as issues with maintaining scroll position as the images are of different lengths and widths. There may be a more elegant solution for formatting the images. However, from what I can tell there isn't a discernable pattern that spans different webtoons. For example, all chapters of one will be formatted the same way but for a different one although consistent with itself is not consistent with the other existing webtoons. This may be worked on later and technically works now for Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Chiniese (simplified and traditional), and English.


## Create React App Scripts below

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
